              Total 4 pages with frontend and backend in each page.
                     1st Page - List of all bloggers on that page
                                       - with Date of published.
                     2nd Page - Clicking on blogger’s name his/her profile page will be opened
                                        - That profile page must have a blogger profile.
                     3rd Page - Login, Registration Page
                    
TIP for frontend - try to enhance pages as much as possible. If you like any animation or something just try to make it from scratch don’t copy/paste it.

       As it’s a simple blogger website. Please try to complete it before the end of June, we would really appreciate if you could complete it little early :)
